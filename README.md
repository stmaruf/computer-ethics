## 📌 Project Summary

With Bangladesh rapidly evolving into a digital-first economy, the country faces growing exposure to cyber threats like data breaches, cyber fraud, and digital exploitation. While current legislation such as the ICT Act (2006) and the Cyber Security Act (2023) address these issues, there is a pressing need for modern reforms aligned with global standards.

This project evaluates Bangladesh's existing cyber laws and suggests reforms based on internationally recognized models like the GDPR (EU), CFAA (USA), and the IT Act (India).
